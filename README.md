# Notepad--
## Just write and save it. That's all ;)

## What is this..?

One day, I thought the text editor that has at least functions. And then, I thought it's quite cool. 'Cause it would be literally 'light-weight' text editor. Therefore, I chose two 'must-need' functions for it. 'Write' and 'Save'. And there are anything except them :O  
Let's think about it. As you might be know the text editor that provide many useful functions likes auto-completion or syntax-highlighting. And VScode and Notepad++ are that things. But on the other side, this program provides only minimun functions through without additional functions to you lol.

Frankly speaking, I'm not sure that I could make this app. Because I'm beginner of programming. I'm just start learning C#. So for this reason, maybe I will do it really little by little if I can start and make it. And this is also why I decide text editor with minimun functions. 'Cause the less functions it have, the less I should have to do it.
Anyway, I think this idea is quite good and funny :) So I made this repo anyway. In conclusion, like its name - notepad-minus-minus which inspired from notepad++ - it will one of the most light text editor. If I could make it :(
